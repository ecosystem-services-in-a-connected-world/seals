# seals_dev

SEALS is under active development and will change much as it moves from a personal research library to supported model. This repository contains the development version of SEALS but does not contain any methods to get the base data necessary to run the model. this will come shortly.

The basic workflow is to run run_seals_0_x_x.py, which defines globals and tasks to run, which are pulled from seals_0_x_x.py.
